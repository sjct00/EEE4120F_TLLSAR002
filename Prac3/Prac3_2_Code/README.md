# Prac4_2_Code
This is the code required for practical 4.2.

For this practical the aim is to debug and create your own modules for an FPGA board using verilog (although you can just do everything in simulation, a physical board is not needed). The practical should be completed in pairs, with only one group member submitting a report. The module you will be creating is a amplitude and phase shifting module, that is given an input as a sine wave and imposes an amplitude and phase shift on it. Moreover, you will be editing a sine wave module so that the values are called from BRAM that you setup. More details on the practical can been found in the updated practical manual on the EEE4120F website: http://ocw.ee.uct.ac.za/courses/EEE4120F/Practicals.html.
