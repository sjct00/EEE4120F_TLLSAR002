# EEE4120F Prac 3

This practical is split up into two section, practical 3.1 FPGA simulation introduction and practical 3.2 FPGA Verilog. The simulation introduction covers installing and the basics of Vivado. Whilst, the Verilog section delves into debugging and creating your own module.

_Title:_
## Simulation-based Intro to IP Core Integration Using Xilinx Vivado

_Objective:_
Learn about using Xilinx Vivado, it's simulator and intergrating an IP core into a project.

Students are guided through building a Xilinx Vivado simulation-based implementation from scratch.
The tutorial is part of the EEE4120F_Practical_Manual.pdf (see http://ocw.ee.uct.ac.za/courses/EEE4120F/Resources/Practicals/EEE4120F_Practical_Manual.pdf).
The code provided here provides starting pieces to this task.
